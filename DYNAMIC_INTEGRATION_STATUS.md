# Dynamic.xyz Integration: Implementation Status

## Current Implementation Status

The Dynamic.xyz wallet integration has been implemented as follows:

1. ✅ Created a React micro-frontend for Dynamic.xyz wallet functionality
2. ✅ Wrapped it as a web component for cross-framework compatibility
3. ✅ Set up Kubernetes deployment configuration for the micro-frontend
4. ✅ Added integration in the YAP Landing Angular application
5. ✅ Configured the web component to pass wallet connection events to Angular

## What's Working

- The web component loads correctly in the YAP Landing application
- The wallet connection event is properly handled by the Angular component
- The wallet address and user ID are captured in the form
- The data is stored in localStorage for persistence

## Testing the Integration

Please refer to the [Dynamic.xyz Wallet Testing Guide](/Users/gregbrown/github/YAP/dynamic-wallet-react/TESTING_GUIDE.md) for instructions on how to test the integration.

## Production Deployment

For production deployment, the following pieces are configured:

1. The `dynamic-wallet-react` service is deployed as a separate service in Kubernetes
2. The service uses environment variables from auth-secrets.yaml for configuration
3. The Angular application is configured to load the web component from the service
4. Communication between the components is handled via DOM events

### Kubernetes Configuration

- The service is configured in `YAP-backend/infra/k8s/dynamic-wallet-react.yaml`
- The service is added to `skaffold.yaml` for local development
- The service uses the `DYNAMIC_ENV_ID` and `DYNAMIC_API_KEY` environment variables from auth-secrets

## Remaining Tasks

1. Test the integration with real wallet connections in a production-like environment
2. Add additional logging and error handling for potential wallet connection issues
3. Update any relevant documentation for users or developers
4. Run end-to-end tests to ensure the complete flow works correctly

## How to Use in Other Parts of the Application

If you need to add the wallet connection functionality to other parts of the application:

1. Add the web component to your template:
   ```html
   <dynamic-wallet-connect
     environment-id="{{dynamicEnvironmentId}}"
     (wallet-connected)="onWalletConnected($event)">
   </dynamic-wallet-connect>
   ```

2. Add the event handler to your component:
   ```typescript
   onWalletConnected(event: CustomEvent) {
     const walletAddress = event.detail.walletAddress;
     const userId = event.detail.userId;
     
     // Handle the wallet connection
     console.log('Wallet connected:', { walletAddress, userId });
   }
   ```

3. Make sure your module imports CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA if it's a different module than app.module.ts.
